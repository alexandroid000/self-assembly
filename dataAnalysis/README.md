This directory is meant for analysing the data collected from the experiements (This could be from the camera or from Gazebo.

I am using https://www.svds.com/jupyter-notebook-best-practices-for-data-science/ as a reference for organizing this directory.

The folder structure works as follows:
data - This is where you LOCALLY store data. DO NOT PUSH LARGE DATA FILES TO GIT!
deliver - This is where the "polished" versions of the notebook will stay. This will most likely be used to house all of the main analysis for a paper/poster/lecture/etc.
develop - This is where day to day experimenting with the data should go. This acts effectively as a scientific journal where you never really erase anything. Write plenty of comments and mark any bad experiments as "[DEAD END]" if they lead to nothing.
figures - This folder stores figures generated by the scripts. These can and should be pushed to the git repo.
src - If the scripts are running a common script then put the script in here to be called.


Before using please install jupyter notebook and do the following to automatically create py and html formats of the ipynb:
1)open up ~/.jupyter/jupyter_notebook_config.py (if it doesnt exist then create it)
2)append the following code snipet to the end https://gist.github.com/jbwhit/881bdeeaae3e4128947c

To get dependencies:
pip install version_information
