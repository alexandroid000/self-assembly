Personal Notes:
TODO) There seems to be a bug in the weaselball code where a mutex causes a crash.
TODO) Create the state analysis
TODO) Get measurements of the robot (Grab a scale!) for gazebo.
TODO) Contact professor Bobadilla regarding what needs to be done for him to analyze the markov chain
TODO) Open up video editing software to see how often the weaselballs are doing a new movement
TODO) Update size of models

Q) When should I do stuff in a plug in and when should I make a ros node?
A) ?

https://answers.ros.org/question/41433/multiple-robots-simulation-and-navigation/ - Good for overview of how to set up multibot
https://github.com/nevinvalsaraj/swarm-gazebo-simulator/ - Example of multibot project
https://github.com/Swarm-IITKgp/swarm_simulator/blob/master/launch/swarm.launch - Another example of multibot project, but I like how they import there robots.
