The PolyominoGenerator.py will generate matrices of Xs for all configurations for a given number of
polyomino units. This is currently only implemented for 4-sided units, and does not handle symmetries,
rotations, or translations.

To use the PolyominoGenerator.py, you must have Python 3 or greater installed. To run, use the Python
command to run PolyominoGenerator.py with an integer "n" for the number of units as an argument:
python PolyominoGenerator.py 1
python PolyominoGenerator.py 8

This program generates and prints to the terminal all different configurations of
polyominos given the number of tiles in the polyomino. A polyomino is a
generalization of a pentomino that can have any number of tiles.

This is currently only implemented for 4-sided tiles, and does not handle symmetries, rotations,
or translations. Implementation ideas in the PolyominoGenerator.py code.

RUNNING THE CODE!!!
To run the program, run the following code in the terminal. It will generate
all possible pnetominoes. To make other polyominos, change the 5 to any given number.
This code must be run using Python 3 (2.7 will not work).

python .\PolyaminoGenerator.py 5
