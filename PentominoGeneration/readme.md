This program generates and prints to the terminal all different configurations of
polyaminos given the number of tiles in the polyamino. A polyamino is a
generalization of a pentomino that can have any number of tiles.

RUNNING THE CODE!!!
To run the program, run the following code in the terminal. It will generate
all possible pentominoes. To make polyaminos, change the 5 to any given number.
This code must be run using python 3 (2.7 will not work).

python .\PolyaminoGenerator.py 5
