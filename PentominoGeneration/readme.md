The PolyominoGenerator.py will generate matrices of Xs for all configurations for a given number of
polyomino units. This is currently only implemented for 4-sided units, and does not handle symmetries,
rotations, or translations.

To use the PolyominoGenerator.py, you must have Python 3 or greater installed. To run, use the Python
command to run PolyominoGenerator.py with an integer "n" for the number of units as an argument:
python PolyominoGenerator.py 1
python PolyominoGenerator.py 8
