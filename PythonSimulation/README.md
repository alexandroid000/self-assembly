Codebase to simulate random walks of weasel balls


This code will serve as a basis for simulating the random walks of weaselballs. 

Initally, I am attempting to create protocols that allow the balls to interact with other balls.

I am trying to build as much as possible from scratch for experience and adaptiveness. I know there are 
packages out there that would greatly simplify this, or could even already do it. However, this is 
as much a learning exercise as it is a final project.
